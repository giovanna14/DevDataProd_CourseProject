# DevDataProd_CourseProject
Project for the Developing Data Products course on Coursera

This repository contains a shinyapp developed as part
of the assignments for the course "Developing Data Products"
of the Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

The application is called `Solar_activity_watcher` and is
hosted on the shinyapps.io server at the URL:
https://giovanna-temporin.shinyapps.io/Solar_activity_watcher

For local use it requires R and RStudio to be installed,
as well as the shiny package.

The application displays a choice of latest images of
the Sun from the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
that are accessed through the ESAC SOHO Archive Inter-Operability
Subsystem, and daily movies of the solar corona produced by
the LASCO Team.
